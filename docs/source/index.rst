DICOM Anonymization API Documentation
=====================================

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2
   :caption: Contents:

Medical imaging has developed into a fundamental tool for diagnostics and decision support. 
This implies that health data is an invaluable resource that needs to be handled with precaution to ensure that all personal data 
is protected in the course of usage and transmission. 
The objective of this project was to develop an application that can query for, anonymize, and push DICOM images into a PACS simulator
while maintaining the integrity of the files and the data within them.
